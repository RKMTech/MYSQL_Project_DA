Products that need to be bought insight:
- Inventory Management: Regularly review stock levels and adjust orders based on sales trends and lead times to maintain optimal inventory levels.
- Hamburger: Although at the threshold, hamburgers should be monitored closely. If the demand is high, consider ordering a small additional quantity to ensure you donâ€™t run out.
- Milkshake: Due to the quantity being well below 50, it is important to reorder milkshake promptly to prevent stockouts and potential loss of sales.
- Ice Cream: This product also requires reordering soon, as its quantity is just below the 50 threshold.
- Customer Demand: Analyze historical sales data to determine if the current quantities are adequate or if higher safety stock levels are needed, especially for high-demand items.
